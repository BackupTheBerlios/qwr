Hi all,

PLEASE READ THESE LINES CAREFULLY

this is a real alpha version, so many things does not work:

- no playback of recorded files 

what do you need to start actually:

- ffmpeg:
  this could be done easily by typing:
  # ./getffmpeg.sh

You need the following packages (development)
(They are usually available on your distribution)

- jack audio connection kit (http://jackaudio.org)
- ogg, theora, vorbis       (http://www.xiph.org)
- qt3                       (http://www.trolltech.com)

The following things might not be integrated in your favorit distribution:
- webcam and driver (video4linux/video4linux2) for that cam
  (make a google search for the usb ID - use "lsusb" to find out)

who to get it run:

# tar xzvf qwr-*.tar.gz
# cd qwr-*
# ./configure
# make
# sudo make install

IMPORTANT TO START:

to start the application, you have to start jackd before (the next line will 
start a jackd server, that connects to alsa and supplies a sample rate of 16 kHz):

# jackd -dalsa -r16000 

then start

# ./QTWebRec

Ask us

- have fun
Suki, Yorn
